# KissanSevak-DBMS-project
An online shopping system that permits a customer to submit online orders for
items and/or services from a store that serves both walk-in customers and online
customers. The online shopping system presents an online display of an order
cut off time and an associated delivery window for items selected by the
customer. The aim of this project is to make farmer’s friendly shopping site
where farmers acts as vendors. Normal shopping sites enable only the website
owner to sell their products but this platform enables every farmer to sell their
products.
Kisaan Sevak is a farmer friendly interface where farmers can sell their
farm products at profitable price. Basically it’s a shopping site where customers
can buy fruits, vegetables and crops directly from farmers. This online shopping
site provides farmers a option of filling their goods information and buyers can
buy the products which farmers want to sell. Thus the site helps farmers to sell
their goods produced.
